#bot rules

All user-facing text and messages in the bot must be defined in the messages.js file. Never hardcode user-facing text directly in command handlers or other components. Always use message keys from messages.js for consistency and easier localization.
Use MarkdownV2 for text formatting in the bot if needed.
Use Persian language for all text in the bot.
Use Persian numbers for all numbers in the bot.
Use Persian characters for all text in the bot.
